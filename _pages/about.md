I am a Ph.D. student in computer science at **[Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/)**, advised by **[Hanspeter Pfister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanspeter_Pfister)**.
I am deeply interested in **computational neuroscience**, particular **connectomics**. My research focuses on building scalable visual analysis tool \& machine-learning algorithms to analyze the hidden architecture of the brain.

I hold an M.Sc. in visual computing from [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/en/) and a B.Sc. (with Honors) in medical informatics from the same university. During my studies, I had some fantastic opportunities to conduct research abroad. For my master thesis research, I visited the [Visual Computing Group](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University. I also interned at Markus Hadwigerâ€™s [High-Performance Visualization Group](http://vccvisualization.org/) at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en) and [Brainlab](https://www.brainlab.com/), Munich.
I was born and raised in the beautiful town [Regensburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regensburg) in Germany - feel free to reach out in English or German.

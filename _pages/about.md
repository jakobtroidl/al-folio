I am a Ph.D. student in computer science at **[Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/)**, advised by **[Hanspeter Pfister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanspeter_Pfister)**.
I am deeply interested in **data visualization**, **computational neuroscience**, and **neural rendering**, especially with applications in **connectomics**. In particular, my research focuses on building scalable visual analysis tools and machine-learning algorithms to analyze the hidden architecture of the brain.

I hold an M.Sc. in visual computing from **[TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/en/)**, Austria and a B.Sc. (with Honors) in medical informatics from the same university.
I was born and raised in the beautiful town of **[Regensburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regensburg)** in Germany.
